## How SSG Works in Nuxt 3

When using SSG, Nuxt pre-renders your pages during the build phase. The result is a collection of HTML files that are directly served by a CDN or static host.


<CodeBlock
  code={`function greet(name: string) {
  return \`Hello, \${name}!\`
}`}
  lang="ts"
  filename="greet.ts"
/>
